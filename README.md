# rainbot-sands

Discord bot that records tabletop RPG sessions, transcribes them with
whisper.cpp, and generates detailed records and recaps with local or cloud
language models. PostgreSQL owns the durable processing queue and pipeline
state, while S3-compatible object storage holds activation audio and generated
session artifacts.

```sh
pnpm install
```

Create a root `.env` and fill in the values needed by the services you run.

Run database migrations:

```sh
pnpm --filter @rainbot/db db:migrate
```

## Development

```sh
pnpm --filter @rainbot/discord dev
pnpm --filter @rainbot/worker dev
pnpm --filter @rainbot/web dev

Keep both buckets private. Transcript and detailed-record objects share the
artifact bucket under separate session/run prefixes; recap and title stay in
Postgres for fast page listings and URL previews. `DELETE_AUDIO_AFTER_TRANSCRIPTION=true`
deletes each activation after its transcript checkpoint has been committed to
Postgres; those checkpoints are cleared once the aggregate transcript artifact
is durable. Configure an audio-bucket lifecycle expiration as a second,
provider-enforced retention boundary;
the application stores stable object keys and does not depend on signed URLs.
Leave application deletion disabled while transcript regeneration is needed.
Recorder and manual-upload scratch files use each service's local temporary
directory and are removed after upload; no shared filesystem is required.
The web service needs artifact read access; the worker needs read/write access.

Summarization and chat use independent provider profiles. Local thinking budgets
accept `0` to disable thinking, a positive token limit, or `-1` for unlimited.
Cloud providers use their corresponding reasoning-effort setting.
